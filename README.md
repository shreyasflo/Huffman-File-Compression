# Huffman-File-Compression
Here, I provide a C++ native implementation of reading the following file [ https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B319laiAPjU3RE1maU9MMlh2dnc/view ] (googlenetweights.h5) and apply lossless compression using HuffMan Coding. I also showcase what is the best compression that you I was able to achieve on it.  I show how data can be encoded and decoded too.
